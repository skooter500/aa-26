# Autonomous Agents Assignment 2026 

Autonomus, Anthropromorphic, Lifeform

Create a 2D, 3D or holographic autonomous lifeform. A virtual creature with a mind of it's own that can autonomously achieve certain tasks. Manipulate the user by whatever means to believe your lifeform is actually "alive" in some primitive or complex way. That it has thoughts and emotions of it's own - however mysterious and artificial they may be.

You can use steering behaviors, procedural animations, FSM architecture, Behavior Tree or an LLM to power the brain of the lifeform.

You should give the lifeform a name, identity and unique personality or pattern of behavoiurs.

You can fork this repo to get lots of steering behaviour and procedural animations
